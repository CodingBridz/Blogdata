   <h4>
	Trust is a bigger part of selling services. A faulty product can be returned, and flaws are relatively objective. But with services, customers may worry about what recourse they will have if they’re unhappy, even if you offer excellent customer service guarantees.

	While the benefits to the consumer should be the focus when you sell both products and services, your qualifications and experience come to the forefront when you’re promoting a service. Service providers span a huuuuuge range of industries—from termite inspectors to business consultants to massage therapists.

	Many service providers work with people’s homes, businesses, and even their bodies, so the impacts can be more personal if things don’t go well. Because consumers are often more cautious, it’s important to demonstrate that they can trust your work, and trust you to make things right if they aren’t happy.
